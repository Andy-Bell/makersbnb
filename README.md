#Maker BnB project
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Andy-Bell/makersbnb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Andy-Bell/makersbnb) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Andy-Bell/makersbnb/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/Andy-Bell/makersbnb?branch=master)

This project is the result of one week's work between four people who were
completely new to the technologies involved. It is currently unfinished, 
but we feel we have learned a lot in the process of making it.

Made as part of the course at [Makers Academy] (www.makersacademy.com).

###App Description

A web application that allows users to list spaces they have available, and to 
hire spaces for the night.

###Styleguide
For contributors, we would like to use [this styleguide] (https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) to achieve code consistency.

###User Stories
These are based on the initial [brief] (https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/lab_week/makers_bnb_specification.md) and can be found [here] (/docs/UserStories.md).

###Testing framework
All tests throughout the stack will be done in [Mocha 2.5.3] (https://mochajs.org/).

###Technologies
The application is built using jQuery front end and Node/Express backend, 
running with a MongoDB database.
